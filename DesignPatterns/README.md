# Design Patterns
Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They are typically used at the code level to solve specific issues related to object-oriented design and interaction.

## Scope

- Design patterns are more about the smaller-scale aspects of code design.
- Design patterns are often used within the context of a single module or component.
