# Design Patterns
Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They are typically used at the code level to solve specific issues related to object-oriented design and interaction.

## Scope
- Focus on solving common problems related to software design and object-oriented programming.
- Operate at a lower level of abstraction, often dealing with individual components or classes.
- Design patterns are more about the smaller-scale aspects of code design.
- Design patterns are often used within the context of a single module or component.
- Design patterns aim to solve specific issues in code design and object interactions.
