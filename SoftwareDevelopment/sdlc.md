# Software Development Life Cycle
Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user’s requirements.

## What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?
SDLC is a process followed for software building within a software organization. SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around development process.

## Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle
SDLC specifies the task(s) to be performed at various stages by a software engineer or developer. It ensures that the end product is able to meet the customer’s expectations and fits within the overall budget.

### Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization.

The quality of the project is a result of planning. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information.

### Stage-2: Defining Requirements
All the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 

This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle.

### Stage-3: Designing Architecture
SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS).

### Stage-4: Developing Product
At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association.

### Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration
At this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested (as in every stage a minimum testing is conducted). This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS.

### Stage-6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products
After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy and then it is tested in a real industrial environment.

## Methods of Software Development Life Cycle
To this day, we have more than 50 recognized SDLC models in use. But None of them is perfect, and each brings its favorable aspects and disadvantages for a specific software development project or a team. Here some:

- Waterfall Model

- Agile Model

- Iterative Model

- Spiral Model

- V-Shaped Model

- Big Bang Model

## What is the need for SDLC?
SDLC is a method, approach, or process that is followed by a software development organization while developing any software. SDLC models were introduced to follow a disciplined and systematic method while designing software. With the software development life cycle, the process of software design is divided into small parts, which makes the problem more understandable and easier to solve. SDLC comprises a detailed description or step-by-step plan for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining the software.

## How to Choose an SDLC Model?
Choosing the right SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) model is essential for project success. Here are the key factors to consider:

### Project Requirements:
- Clear Requirements: Use Waterfall or V-Model if requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
- Changing Requirements: Use Agile or Iterative models if requirements are unclear or likely to evolve.

### Project Size and Complexity:
- Small Projects: Use Waterfall or RAD for small, simple projects.
- Large Projects: Use Agile, Spiral, or DevOps for large, complex projects that need flexibility.

### Team Expertise:
- Experienced Teams: Use Agile or Scrum if the team is familiar with iterative development.
- Less Experienced Teams: Use Waterfall or V-Model for teams needing structured guidance.

### Client Involvement:
- Frequent Client Feedback: Use Agile, Scrum, or RAD if regular client interaction is needed.
- Minimal Client Involvement: Use Waterfall or V-Model if client involvement is low after initial planning.

### Time and Budget Constraints:
- Fixed Time and Budget: Use Waterfall or V-Model if you have strict time and budget limits.
- Flexible Time and Budget: Use Agile or Spiral if you can adjust time and budget as needed.

### Risk Management:
- High-Risk Projects: Use Spiral for projects with significant risks and uncertainties.
- Low-Risk Projects: Use Waterfall for projects with minimal risks.

### Product Release Timeline:
- Quick Release Needed: Use Agile or RAD to deliver products quickly.
- Longer Development Time: Use Waterfall or V-Model for projects with no urgent deadlines.

### Maintenance and Support:
- Long-Term Maintenance: Use Agile or DevOps for projects needing continuous updates and support.
- Minimal Maintenance: Use Waterfall or V-Model if little future maintenance is expected.

### Stakeholder Expectations:
- High Stakeholder Engagement: Use Agile or Scrum if stakeholders want ongoing involvement.
- Low Stakeholder Engagement: Use Waterfall or V-Model if stakeholders prefer involvement only at major milestones.
