# Object Oriented Programming in Python

OOP is a programming paradigm that uses `objects` to design software. Objects are instance of classes, which can hold data and methods to manipulate that data. OOP focuses on:
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Class
A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure). It defines a set of attribuets and methods that the created objects will have.

[Details with example](./class_and_object.md)

## Object
An instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.

[Details with example](./class_and_object.md)

## Encapsulation
The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class and restricting access to some of the object's components.

[Details with example](./encapsulation.md)

## Abstraction
Hiding the complexity reality while exposing only the necessary parts, it helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

[Details with example](./abstraction.md)

## Inheritance
The mechanism by which one class (child class) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent class).

[Details with example](./inheritance.md)

## Polymorphism
The ability to present the same interface for differen data types. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

[Details with example](./polymorphism.md)

## Abstract Class in Python
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used to define common methods or attributes that must be implemented by its subclasses. Abstract classes serve as blueprints for other classes.
