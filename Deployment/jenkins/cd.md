# What is Continuous Delivery (CD) in Agile?
Continuous Delivery (CD) in Agile methodology is a software delivery process of short iterations and releasing new functionality once, it is ready for release.

1. This involves the seamless and automated delivery of software in a small and incremental way.

2. The primary goal of continuous delivery is to enable frequent release of software into production rapidly and predictably aligned with the principles of agile methodologies.

## Key Concepts and Principles of Continuous Delivery in Agile
1. Sprint-based releases: In agile scrum, every sprint becomes a potential release candidate enabled by the continuous delivery process. This leads to smaller and more frequent deployments for successful releases.

2. Automation of all processes: Automating the build, testing, delivery, and deployment processes is the most important step in implementing continuous delivery in Agile.

3. Build Quality: The quality of process and delivery is an integrated part of every continuous delivery in agile. All new piece of delivery is passed through automated tests to ensure everything is bug-free and meets the performance metrics for the highest quality.

4. Reduced Risk: The automated testing and build process helps to avoid any bugs reaching production. This leads to quality delivery, improved software stability, and higher user satisfaction.

5. Faster Feedback: Continuous delivery helps software features be added to production frequently and at a faster pace, which helps to receive quick user feedback, allowing the scrum team to adapt and iterate quickly.

6. Improved Team Focus: Continuous delivery enables developers to focus on development and providing solutions, while it handles the deployment and delivery.

## Key Steps in the Continuous Delivery Agile
1. Code Development: While implementing the continuous delivery process in Agile for software development, the developers work on small and manageable pieces of functionality like user stories and write software code to add these features.

2. Continuous Integration: Continuous integration occurs before the continuous delivery, when developers integrate their code changes to a version control repository like GIT.

3. Artifact Generation: When successful integration and testing are done, the continuous integration process generates the artifacts such as compiled binaries or deployable packages for deployment to the server.

4. Deployment Automation: Once the artifacts are generated the automated deployment takes these and deploys to the target server environment across different stages.

5. Release to Production: In the continuous delivery process, once the automated tests in staging environment pass for the changes completed, the software changes are released to the production environment using different deployment methods to avoid any downtime.

6. Monitoring and Feedback: After deployment is completed in production for particular release, continuous monitoring is done to gather any issue logs and other metrics to gather feedback on the performance and behavior of the application.

7. Continuous Improvement: The continuous delivery in agile emphasizes continuous improvement and delivering value to customers continuously and in a more effective way.

## Tools
- `Version Control`: GIT, SVN, Bitbucket, GitLab, GitHub and Mercurial are some of the version control tools that aids in the continuous delivery process. The version control tools help to track code changes, manage versions and collaborate with team for all code updates.

- `CI/CD Tools`: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps and CircleCI are some of the best CI/CD tools, which help to navigate development delivery.

- `Testing Tools`: Selenium, Jira, Bugzilla, JMeter and LoadRunner are some of the testing and bug tracking tools.

- `Ansible`: It is used for configuration management, software deployment and task automation.

- `Chef and Puppet`: They are configuration management tools used for automation of infrastructure management.

## Best Practices
- `Automate everything`: Automation of continuous delivery process is the key to reducing human errors, saving time, and ensuring consistency of continuous delivery.

- `Use Version Control`: Using the version control helps to track and manage changes to code base and roll back to previous versions, if situations arise. So version control tools should be used for code, scripts, configurations and documentation.

- `Implement Testing strategy`: Testing of the code is very essential to ensure quality and reliability before delivery. Testing strategy should be implemented to cover different types of tests like Unit test, Integration Test, Functional and Performance Tests. Testing tools should be used to run tests frequently

- `Infrastructure as Code (IaC)`: Implement the IaC to define and manage infrastructure using code for consistent and continuous deployment.

- `Monitoring and Feedback`: To make the Continuous Delivery successful, continuous monitoring of the deployed applications and gathering feedback from users is very crucial.

- `Adopt a Culture of Collaboration`: For successful continuous delivery, fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement is the key within the team members, stakeholders, and users.
