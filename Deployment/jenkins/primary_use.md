# Primary Uses of Jenkins in DevOps
Jenkins is a versatile open-source software that provides an automation server that helps automate repetitive tasks within the process of software development. It not only supports the construction, testing, and optimization processes of applications but also automates the entire procedure from code commit to production deployment.

1. `Continuous Integration (CI)`: Jenkins's main purpose is to automate the CI process, in which it combines multiple contributors code changes into a common repo. It keeps tracking version control systems as new commits are submitted, triggers build tasks, executes automated tests, and provides code quality checking and stability appearance in real-time.

2. `Continuous Delivery (CD)`: Jenkins XML goes beyond CI, which means that it is not just for the process of continuous delivery but also assists in automating the process of delivering changes to production environments reliably and efficiently. It coordinates deployment pipelines from artifact packaging to environment provisioning, performing deployment scripts, delivering updates, and deploying them fluently.

3. `Automated Testing`: Jenkins teams up with different testing frameworks and tools that are used to automate the performance of unit tests, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. It arranges test cases, enables test report generation, and alerts developers to failed tests, resulting in early defect identification, and the code quality is always maintained during the development process.

4. `Infrastructure as Code (IaC)`: Jenkins encourages the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure by deriving plugins and integrations within tools like Ansible, Terraform, and Chef. It enables IaC implementation where infrastructure changes are committed into a repository, tested, and deployed along with application code, consequently driving more problems in repeatability and correlation.

5. `Deployment Automation`: Jenkins removes the barriers due to bottlenecks and human errors by using the deployment scripts to execute them, rolling updates, and blue-green deployments. It brings visibility into the deployment progress, logs and metrics, with teams being able to roll out changes fast and reliably with the headache of proper downtime.
