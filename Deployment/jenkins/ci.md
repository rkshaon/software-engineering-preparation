# What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration, also known or called as CI in short. It is a part of the software development process generally used in DevOps practices where users/teams can collaborate and seamlessly work together to integrate new code changes or add new features into the existing codebase using a version control system.

- With `Continuous Integration (CI)` you or your team members can automate project workflows and simplify the process of building, testing, and deployment of software to different stages in the environment. Here environments are nothing but Staging, Dev, Test, QA and Prod.

- `Continuous Integration (CI)` will improve communication, track changes, fix bugs, and reduce conflicts in the code.

## What Continuous Integration (CI) does?
Continuous Integration (CI) follows the fundamental practices of planning, coding, making changes or merging, checking results, and pushing. To adapt CI to your project, the first thing you do is find the perfect services and DevOps tools. Here are some of best continuous integration tools currently used by many organization:

- Jenkins
- CircleCI
- GitHub Actions
- Azure Pipelines
- GitLab CI/CD
- Bitbucket Pipelines

With these CI tools, you can manage source code, versioning, build, test and release.

## Workflow

`User(s)/Team(s)` >> `Plan` >> `Code` >> `Merge changes to Source Branch` >> `Build Artifact` >> `Test the Functionality` >> `Submit Checks and Report`. 

## Why is Continuous Integration Needed?
Adopting Continuous Integration with help to improve code and software quality in a phase wise manner. By automating the CI software developers can spend more time on tasks related to new code additions and fixing bugs rather than focusing on infrastructure deployment.

## How does Continuous Integration Work?
Assume that you have CI Repo (Branch as Release). Whenever you or your teammates commit any changes to the code repository and the CI service automatically fetches the commit changes done by you or your teams and builds the artifacts and deploys to the environment.

## Continuous Integration Benefits
Continuous Integration (CI) simplifies the process of automating the tasks. These are some benefits that you should be aware of.

- `Reduce Manual Tasks`: CI helps in reducing the manual tasks involved in the software development process. By reducing the manual activities in the projects save lot of time and efforts.

- `Code Integrations and Improvements`: Help to improve code quality by automating the testing of code changes and by providing developers with feedback on their changes.

- `Collaboration with Team members`: If you are in a team working together with your team members then this CI will help your developers team to share and integrate their work. This will improve communication and reduce conflicts in the code.

- `Visibility and Transparency`: CI provides developers with visibility of code change. This helps developers to quickly identify the changes and to fix problems ASAP.

- `Faster Release`: When you set up continuous integration with continuous deployment, your changes will be live whenever you make changes to your code and push it to the release branch.
