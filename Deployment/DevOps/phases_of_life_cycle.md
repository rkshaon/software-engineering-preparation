# Phases of Life Cycle

1. **Plan**: Professionals determine the commercial need and gather end-user opinions throughout this level. In this step, they design a project plan to optimize business impact and produce the intended result.

2. **Code** – During this point, the code is being developed. To simplify the design process, the developer team employs lifecycle DevOps tools and extensions like Git that assist them in preventing safety problems and bad coding standards.

3. **Build** – After programmers have completed their tasks, they use tools such as Maven and Gradle to submit the code to the common code source. 

4. **Test** – To assure software integrity, the product is first delivered to the test platform to execute various sorts of screening such as user acceptability testing, safety testing, integration checking, speed testing, and so on, utilizing tools such as JUnit, Selenium, etc. 

5. **Release** – At this point, the build is prepared to be deployed in the operational environment. The DevOps department prepares updates or sends several versions to production when the build satisfies all checks based on the organizational demands.

6. **Deploy** – At this point, Infrastructure-as-Code assists in creating the operational infrastructure and subsequently publishes the build using various DevOps lifecycle tools.

7. **Operate** – This version is now convenient for users to utilize. With tools including Chef, the management department take care of server configuration and deployment at this point. 

8. **Monitor** – The DevOps workflow is observed at this level depending on data gathered from consumer behavior, application efficiency, and other sources. The ability to observe the complete surroundings aids teams in identifying bottlenecks affecting the production and operations teams’ performance.
