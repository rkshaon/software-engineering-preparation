# DevOps Life Cycle
DevOps is a practice that enables a single team to handle the whole application lifecycle, including development, testing, release, deployment, operation, display, and planning. It is a mix of the terms “Dev” (for development) and “Ops” (for operations).

DevOps Lifecycle is the set of phases that includes DevOps for taking part in Development and Operation group duties for quicker software program delivery. DevOps follows positive techniques that consist of code, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, displaying, and planning. DevOps lifecycle follows a range of phases such as non-stop development, non-stop integration, non-stop testing, non-stop monitoring, and non-stop feedback.

## 7 Cs of DevOps 
1. **Continuous Development**: In Continuous Development code is written in small, continuous bits rather than all at once, Continuous Development is important in DevOps because this improves efficiency every time a piece of code is created, it is tested, built, and deployed into production.

2. **Continuous Integration**: Continuous Integration can be explained mainly in 4 stages in DevOps. They are as follows:
    1. Getting the SourceCode from SCM (Source Code Management) (ex. Github is one of the most popular tool)
    2. Building the code (ex. Maven can build code into the required packages like war, jar ear etc)
    3. Code quality review (ex. SonarQube can perform code quality review where it will generate report of code quality)
    4. Storing the build artifacts 

3. **Continuous Testing**: We can deploy  continuous testing with the use of the agile and DevOps methodologies. Depending on our needs, we can perform continuous testing using automation testing tools such as Testsigma, Selenium, LambdaTest, etc.

4. **Continuous Deployment/Continuous Delivery**:

    ***Continuous Deployment:*** Continuous Deployment is the process of automatically deploying an application into the production environment when it has completed testing and the build stages. Here, we’ll automate everything from obtaining the application’s source code to deploying it.

    ***Continuous Delivery:*** Continuous Delivery is the process of deploying an application into production servers manually when it has completed testing and the build stages. Here, we’ll automate the continuous integration processes, however, manual involvement is still required for deploying it to the production environment.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**: DevOps lifecycle is incomplete if there was no Continuous Monitoring. Continuous Monitoring can be achieved with the help of Prometheus and Grafana we can continuously monitor and can get notified before anything goes wrong with the help of Prometheus we can gather many performance measures, including CPU and memory utilization, network traffic, application response times, error rates, and others. Grafana makes it possible to visually represent and keep track of data from time series, such as CPU and memory utilization.

6. **Continuous Feedback**: Continuous Feedback can increase the performance of the application and reduce bugs in the code making it smooth for end users to use the application.

7. **Continuous Operations**: More output, lower manufacturing costs, and better quality control are benefits of continuous operations.
