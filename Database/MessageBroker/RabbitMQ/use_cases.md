# Use Cases
RabbitMQ is widely used in various scenarios, including:

- `Microservices Communication`: Enabling different microservices to communicate with each other without direct dependencies.

- `Long-running Tasks`: Offloading resource-intensive or time-consuming tasks (like image processing, email sending, or report generation) to background workers, improving application responsiveness.

- `Notifications and Alerts`: Sending real-time notifications to users or other systems.

- `Distributed Systems`: Providing a reliable messaging backbone for complex, distributed applications.

- `Task Queues`: Managing and distributing tasks among a pool of workers.

## Examples
- Background jobs

- Email/SMS notifications

- Task queues
