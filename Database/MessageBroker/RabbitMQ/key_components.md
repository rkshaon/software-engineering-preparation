# Key Components
Key Components:

- `Producer`: An application that sends messages to RabbitMQ.

- `Exchange`: Receives messages from producers and routes them to one or more queues based on predefined rules (e.g., routing keys, exchange types).

- `Queue`: A named buffer that stores messages until they are consumed.

- `Consumer`: An application that receives and processes messages from a queue.

- `Binding`: A link that tells an exchange which queues to route messages to based on certain criteria.
